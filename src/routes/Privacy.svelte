<p>For example, some project captions use <a href="https://shields.io/">shields.io</a> images and, like most Content Delivery Networks, shields.io use a DDOS protection service like Cloud Flare.</p>
<p>Cloud Flare sets a cookie called "__cfduid" which is used for tracking.</p>
<p>I cannot control this.</p>
<p>To opt out from this, I recommend blocking all cookies on the jonmarsh.dev domain.</p>
