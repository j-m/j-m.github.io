<h2>Privacy/Cookie policy</h2>

<p>I do not directly use any cookies whatsoever, be it for tracking, functional purposes, or otherwise.</p>
<p>Any cookies set or fetched on this website belong to 3rd party sources.</p>
<p>For example, some project captions use <a href="https://shields.io/">shields.io</a> images and, like most Content Delivery Networks, shields.io use a DDOS protection service like Cloud Flare.</p>
<p>Cloud Flare sets a cookie called "__cfduid" which is used for tracking.</p>
<p>I cannot control this.</p>
<p>To opt out from this, I recommend blocking all cookies on the jonmarsh.dev domain.</p>
<p>As there are many web browsers out there, I cannot possibly give instructions for all of them.</p>
<p>So, please refer to the manual/help section of your web browser or simply search online for how to disable cookies.</p>
